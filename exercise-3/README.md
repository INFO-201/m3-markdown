# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

# cp
The `cp` command can be used to _copy_ a file or folder. For example:

```
cp my-photo.png my-photo2.png
```

Here's some more information about the `cp` command:

- It can be used to _recursively_ copy a directory with the `-R` option: `cp -R folder-1 folder-2`
- You can print out progress to the terminal using the `-v` command, making it _verbose_): `cp -R -v folder-1 folder-2`

See `complete` branch for answers.
